# An Insurrectionist Can Not Be President
This web page is a dedicated information clearinghouse for efforts to bring about a Supreme Court case to decide whether Donald J. Trump is ineligible for the Presidency due to Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
# Background
Section 3 of the US Constitution says: 
> No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. 

In other words, if Mr. Trump has engaged in insurrection or has "given aid or comfort" to enemies of the United States, he cannot be President again. A vote of two-thirds from both the Senate and House of Representatives would be required to override this rule.

Many have assumed that this Constitutional restriction is obsolete in today's world. However, law school professors William Baude from the University of Chicago and Michael Stokes Paulsen from the University of St. Thomas have [argued otherwise in a 126-page article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4532751).[^1]

Simply having a couple of law professors claim Mr. Trump is ineligible doesn't automatically keep him off the ballot or out of the White House. As of now, he remains the leading Republican Party candidate for the office of President of the United States.

# Taking Action
Baude and Poulson write:
> **We the People should honor and vigorously enforce this important provision of our Constitution**. It should not be allowed to become a dead letter from disuse... That means that those who possess the power and duty to apply and enforce Section Three have a constitutional responsibility to do so, fairly but vigorously. If state election boards or secretaries of state determine that a candidate for state elective office or a candidate seeking to represent that state in Congress is constitutionally disqualified from holding that office, those state authorities should exercise the state-law powers they possess to remove ineligible candidates from the ballot. If the House or Senate determines that a person elected to serve as a member of such body is constitutionally disqualified from holding such a position, they should refuse to seat or expel that person. **And if a candidate for President, or an already-elected President, is constitutionally disqualified from office by Section Three, then that disqualification should be enforced by state election officials, by electors, by Congress through the impeachment process, and by the Vice-President, cabinet and, Congress in carrying out the Twenty-fifth Amendment**.[^1]
[Emphasis ours.]


And with respect to the example of a Presidential candidate, and after some discussion, they write:
> ...if state officials excluded him from ballot eligibility, he would likely be able to sue in state or federal court to challenge state officialsâ€™ determination of ineligibility. And if he was not excluded by state officials, voters (at least in some states) might possess the legal right to challenge his eligibility. Either way, such a challenge would present a classic legal case or controversy. It is not difficult to imagine such suit being resolved by courts. Indeed, given the magnitude of the question and its consequences, **it is not difficult to imagine such an important case making its way quickly to the U.S. Supreme Court**. It would then become the province and duty of the Court to determine and apply the meaning of Section Three.[^1]
[Emphasis ours.]


But what can you and I, who are not officeholders with the power to execute the actions mentioned above, do?

## We can spread the word.
Everyone should be aware that we, as regular citizens, possess the power to influence this situation. If we don't act, then who will? If ballot-controlling officials believe voters are indifferent, how many will risk their professional standing to take a stand?

It's our responsibility to raise our voices and initiate momentum. Only then can there be moral and, eventually, financial backing to ensure that Section 3 has tangible consequences in the real world.


## Money is needed for lawsuits.
We must identify avenues to secure funds for filing lawsuits should Mr. Trump be placed on the ballot despite potential ineligibility for another presidential term.

Regardless of the initial lawsuit's outcome, appeals will likely ensue until at least one case reaches the Supreme Court. Such a process will incur significant legal expenses. Currently, we are unaware of any initiatives to raise funds for this purpose.

## Money will need to be raised to defend against lawsuits.
We can be sure that any decision by a public official to exclude Mr. Trump from a state ballot will result in lawsuits. Both the official and their decision will require legal defense, and one of these cases might make its way to the Supreme Court.

A primary objective of this site is to monitor fundraising efforts related to this cause. As these initiatives emerge, we will provide information on where people can contribute.

# FAQ
## If Donald J. Trump is an insurrectionist, why didn't Jack Smith charge him with that crime?
It's possible that Smith is considering it, especially if he's working towards persuading one or more of the currently unindicted co-conspirators to cooperate and provide evidence supporting such a charge.

When contemplating a charge of insurrection against Trump, Smith would certainly consider the fact that criminal charges demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a rigorous standard, set so high because society prioritizes preventing the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals.

In contrast, civil cases operate under the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. This means if there's more evidence suggesting Trump "engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [Constitution], or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof," he could be deemed liable and barred from office.

This civil standard is distinct from the criminal charges currently facing Trump. The evidence threshold is lower in civil cases. Even if he's never convicted of a crime or is in fact unconvictable because of the required standard of proof, there remains the possibility that he could be prohibited from the Presidency under Section 3.

## Who is behind this site?
Gary Robinson created it. He is the first inventor of the tracking cookie. [His patent, with a priority date of 1995](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c3/d4/40/239073914fa7fc/US5918014.pdf), did not claim the tracking cookie on its own, so anyone could use it; and it discussed many features for privacy and user control that are like the ones web sites are finally, in the last few years, being forced by law to use. (The phrase "tracking cookie" is coined in Column 10, Line 9.)

He also wrote an [article about a statistical technique](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6467) he invented that was used in a number of award-winning spam filters.

Today, he is very concerned about the future of American democracy and would like to help in whatever small way he can.
