# An Insurrectionist Can Not Be President
This web page is a dedicated information clearinghouse for efforts to bring about a Supreme Court case to decide whether Donald J. Trump is ineligible for the Presidency due to Section 3 of the United States Constitution.
# Background
Section 3 of the US Consitution says: 
> No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, un- der the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. 

In other words, if Mr. Trump is an insurrectist or has "given aid or comfort" to enemies of the United States, he cannot be President again without a vote of two-thirds of both the Senate and House of Representatives to overcome this rule.

In general, it has been assumed that this Constitutional restriction is obsolete and does not apply to today's world. However, two law school professors, William Baude of the University of Chicago and Michael Stokes Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas have written a 126-page article describing why they have come to the opposite conclusion.[^1]

Of course, just because there are law professors who say Mr. Trump is ineligible to be President is not going to automatically keep him off the ballot or prevent him from moving into the White House. So, as things stand, he remains the leading Republican Party candidate for the office of President of the United States.

# Taking Action
Baude and Poulson write:
> **We the People should honor and vigorously enforce this important provision of our Constitution**. It should not be allowed to become a dead letter from disuse... That means that those who possess the power and duty to apply and enforce Section Three have a constitutional responsibility to do so, fairly but vigorously. If state election boards or secretaries of state determine that a candidate for state elective office or a candidate seeking to represent that state in Congress is constitutionally disqualified from holding that office, those state authorities should exercise the state-law powers they possess to remove ineligible candidates from the ballot. If the House or Senate determines that a person elected to serve as a member of such body is constitutionally disqualified from holding such a position, they should refuse to seat or expel that person. **And if a candidate for President, or an already-elected President, is constitutionally disqualified from office by Section Three, then that disqualification should be enforced by state election officials, by electors, by Congress through the impeachment process, and by the Vice-President, cabinet and, Congress in carrying out the Twenty-fifth Amendment**.[^1]


And with respect to the example of a Presidential candidate, and after some discussion, they write:
> ...if state officials excluded him from ballot eligibility, he would likely be able to sue in state or federal court to challenge state officialsâ€™ determination of ineligibility. And if he was not excluded by state officials, voters (at least in some states) might possess the legal right to challenge his eligibility. Either way, such a challenge would present a classic legal case or controversy. It is not difficult to imagine such suit being resolved by courts. Indeed, given the magnitude of the question and its consequences, **it is not difficult to imagine such an important case making its way quickly to the U.S. Supreme Court**. It would then become the province and duty of the Court to determine and apply the meaning of Section Three.[^1]


But what can you and I do, who are not officeholders with the power to take the actions mentioned above? There are two main aspects.

## We can spread the word.
Everyone needs to know that we, as regular citizens, have the power to do something about this. Moreover, if we don't, who will? If the officials who control who's on the ballot don't think voters care, how many would take the professional risk of taking a stand? 

It's up to us to make some noise and get the ball rolling so that there will be moral and, eventually, financial support for enabling Section 3 to have a real-world effect.


## Money will need to be raised to sue.
We will need to find ways of making money available to file lawsuits when Mr. Trump is put on the ballot despite his arguable ineligibility to be President again. 

And then, whatever the outcome of the initial lawsuit is, that outcome will be appealed until at least one such case gets to the Supreme Court. That process will involve a lot of legal bills. At present, we know of no one working to raise money to pay for it.

## Money will need to be raised to defend against lawsuits.
We can be certain that any action of a public official preclusing Mr. Trump from appearing on the ballot in a particular state will lead to lawsuits. That official and the action they took will need to be defended in court, and it may be one of these cases that ends up in the Supreme Court.

One intent of this site is to keep track of any such fundraising efforts as they become known, so that people will know where to send money.
